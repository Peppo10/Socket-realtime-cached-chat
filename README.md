# WinApi-socket-realtime-cached-chat
This is a realtime chat that uses WinApi to manage sockets and create tcp connection between server and client. Also implements a caching system that save the messages between two peers.

The avaiable executables can make connection in localhost. If you want to change ip, you just have to change the ip from client side sourcecode(server is listening for all interfaces)
